ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I'm @Mohdnihal03, currently immersing myself in the realm of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for my B.E.
ðŸ‘€ I'm on the lookout for exhilarating projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
ðŸŒ± Armed with hands-on experience, I navigate seamlessly through Django, PostgreSQL, and machine learning, with a knack for leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs).
Feel the pulse of my journey by exploring my GitHub profile and the electrifying projects I'm engaged in!
